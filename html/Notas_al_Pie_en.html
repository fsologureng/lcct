	<p>"Chile woke up, tell me something prettier than that", is the phrase that is found in the structure of the bus stop. From here I see this new city, chaotic, rowdy..., but alive, more alive than ever. Through here the runaway boredom of neoliberal order passed by, when we grew tired of being people of mortgaged life and we got messy, we got overflowed with creative and dismissal rage to be again the throbbing and constituent people. The walls of Chile, like a palimpset, show the pain and hope. I am still at the bus stop. How far will the rout go?... "Until dignity becomes a habit".</p>

	<p>Fourteen years ago, even though that meanings and justifications for the design of these bus stops were sought, for the eyes of the citizens they always looked as an electrocardiogram. Today that interpretation seems prophetic.</p>
	<p>The electrocardiogram is the graphic representation of the electric activity of the heart in function of the time. In the current landscape this interpretation takes on a greater meaning. The rage, passion, fury and adrenaline marking the peak of the agitated heart of the people that demands dignity, contrast with the minimal and eventually absent activity that is produced on the other end of this journey where, on the opposite sidewalk, the cold ruler stare limits to stubbornly contemplate the place where once was the flame that they thought eternal, but today dying, waits for its end.</p>

	<p>It's New Year's Eve and we stop by “Plaza de la Dignidad” before going to our party. An eternal sound that remains in my ear and demands dignity. A constant beat that is repeated, amplified by the hands that collide with the metal sheets that shield Telefonica’s tower. It's night to celebrate and get lost, but here we are hitting the wall. A nocturne trance between the burning candles honoring those fallen in the fight. A sound, a cry, catharsis and a collective hug; so not to forget why we wake up every day after 10/18. Now, we loose ourselves to always return.</p>

	<p>The Streets and the Magic Pad</p>
	<p>
	The Uprising is an exercise of writing and drawing. Given the provocation to think about the blocks and blocks full of graffiti, I can't stop thinking about Sigmund Freud's Magic pad. This children's toy that allows to write and then erase to rewrite or draw. The blackboard was –for Freud– a representation of our psychic apparatus, the events of our life are inscribed in our psyche, but cannot remain as 'graphos' forever. The 'Magic pad' with a simple movement makes the writing disappear, but actually if we take a closer look, each writing remains influencing the writing to come. The unconscious of the magic board; our unconscious; or the one of our city collects that writing gone. Today - like Freud's magic pad- the streets turn white, but underneath those layers of new paint, the old paint continues to speak to us.</p>

	<p>With nostalgia I look at those portrayed streets, so colorful and full of content, each brick painted with a message that cry out for a dignified future. They were my daily life until recently, and have become longing in times of quarantine. But they are not the streets that I knew all my life, not at all, those were gray, “boring”, contained streets. Since October 18, the streets in my city have become a space of freedom and resistance that were built in the heat of the marches, evasions and barricades. They can paint them over and over again, but they could never erase the new world that was drawn on them.</p>

	The street, like Altamira, offers us the walls as a canvas in a cave. From anonymity, spontaneous drawings emerge, which express in the most primary, and visceral way the message. This, full of a political burden, makes the city scream at us. It face us to the general malaise of a society subjugated for years, which demands changes and a decent way of living. This tour invites us to look, dialogue and above all to reflect on these texts, to recognize ourselves in the messages featured on this imaginary, made in communion and by a new collectivity of people that has awakened.</p>

History teaches us that, in those cases, the city walls are the blackboard of frustrated aspirations, hatreds and loves of the common citizen. This was the case during the Bolshevik revolution of 1917, the Mexican agrarian revolution of 1910 or the uprising of Paris in 1968, when the city walls received slogans such as “Forbidden to Forbid” or “Let's be realistic: ask for the impossible.”</p>

	<p>New Popular Hagiography</p>
	<p>The street becomes the space for a popular identity with its own forms of memory and aesthetic expression. One of the most striking manifestations is the resignification of national cultural and political icons in terms of popular religiosity. More than a religious metaphysics, the force of the religious symbol is instrumentalized to elevate the carriers of the popular struggle. The bleeding eye displaces the sacred heart as a symbol of sacrifice (to make sacred), for the sake of an egalitarian society. The visages of Camilo Catrillanca, Alex Lemún, Gustavo Gatica, Fabiola Campillai, high school students, Gabriela Mistral, Violeta Parra, Mon Laferte, Negro Matapacos, Pedro Lemebel, Víctor Jara, Gladys Marín, Clotario Blest, Jorge González and even Felipe Camiroaga superimposed on religious images exemplify this act. This new popular hagiography is the testimony of the popular rebellion against the Chilean oligarchical and hierocratic opression.</p>

	The detection of places where violation of fundamental rights of women and girls occur. Corners, buildings, streets, churches, is one of the exercises we do when we link the city with our daily life and the macho violence that hits our bodies and the bodies of others. Understanding the city form that point allows us to open our senses and pay attention to what is invisible; a dark memory of our life or a piece of paper without sender in the courts of law. The eradication of sexist violence happens since the feminist questions, intervene and are part of the decisions that are taken in the cities, only that way we will be able to build a feminist city.</p>

I think about myself, about my desire for change, and my belief that nothing ever changes.</p>
	<p>And then, I think of everything that has changed, everything that will change, and the ways in which I have changed. It’s a great mental exercise to imagine ourselves as static, still, as if to say that nothing changes: to imagine a motionless detail, a single element that never changes, that hides under a veil everything that, in fact, is always changing. And how awful it would be to never change, to be so consistent with myself-yesterday-today-and-always that I have no room to be anyone else.</p>

	<p>There are two dimensions that I want to highlight from "The city as text". The first is the multiplicity of elements that come together in the landscape that make up this photomontage. The city, far from being a singular and unitary entity, emerges here as a space arranged by a heterogeneity of practices and bodies, writings and walls, infrastructures and wiring, flows and atmospheres. Second, the landscape strongly represents the idea of dissent as the quintessential political moment. The work shows a city in crisis, but at the same time a city that transforms disagreements and differences into a possibility to re-imagine the type of society we want.</p>

	<p>"Let them all go", is read in the front wall of the Church of San Francisco.</p>

	In high school, a history teacher showed us a picture of some farmers (zapatistas, I think), holding a sign that said, "Let them all go". The teacher asked us, "who will come next if everybody leaves?" And then he said something about the respect towards the authority. I felt fear of the chaos.</p>
	<p>
	Today I do not fear. Our politics is the art to imagine worlds that don't even exist. And in that future, the death of the king, is not a synonymous of chaos. Because the embraced bodies are the ones that will resist.</p>
